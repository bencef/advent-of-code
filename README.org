* About
These are my solutions for the [[http://adventofcode.com/][advent of code]] coding challenge.

* File structure

All solutions are under the path =<year>/<day>/<programming language>=.

* Languages

Here's a brief summary for the languages used.
The goal is not to give a comprehensive or even fair overview of the languages,
but to give enough information so the solutions are readable for anyone
(who already knows a few programming languages)
